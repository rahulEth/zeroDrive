# creating new schema

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
node v18.19.1

create .env file and copy past .sample_env file


# creating new schema

cd sign-protocol

node index.js

```
